        "description": "<p>Returns a set of temporary security credentials that you can use to access Amazon Web Services resources. These temporary credentials consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Typically, you use <code>AssumeRole</code> within your account or for cross-account access. For a comparison of <code>AssumeRole</code> with other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html\">Requesting Temporary Security Credentials</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison\">Comparing the Amazon Web Services STS API operations</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Permissions</b> </p> <p>The temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRole</code> can be used to make API calls to any Amazon Web Services service with the following exception: You cannot call the Amazon Web Services STS <code>GetFederationToken</code> or <code>GetSessionToken</code> API operations.</p> <p>(Optional) You can pass inline or managed <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session\">session policies</a> to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policy Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) to use as managed session policies. The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent Amazon Web Services API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session\">Session Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>When you create a role, you create two policies: a role trust policy that specifies <i>who</i> can assume the role, and a permissions policy that specifies <i>what</i> can be done with the role. You specify the trusted principal that is allowed to assume the role in the role trust policy.</p> <p>To assume a role from a different account, your Amazon Web Services account must be trusted by the role. The trust relationship is defined in the role's trust policy when the role is created. That trust policy states which accounts are allowed to delegate that access to users in the account. </p> <p>A user who wants to access a role in a different account must also have permissions that are delegated from the account administrator. The administrator must attach a policy that allows the user to call <code>AssumeRole</code> for the ARN of the role in the other account.</p> <p>To allow a user to assume a role in the same account, you can do either of the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Attach a policy to the user that allows the user to call <code>AssumeRole</code> (as long as the role's trust policy trusts the account).</p> </li> <li> <p>Add the user as a principal directly in the role's trust policy.</p> </li> </ul> <p>You can do either because the role’s trust policy acts as an IAM resource-based policy. When a resource-based policy grants access to a principal in the same account, no additional identity-based policy is required. For more information about trust policies and resource-based policies, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html\">IAM Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Tags</b> </p> <p>(Optional) You can pass tag key-value pairs to your session. These tags are called session tags. For more information about session tags, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html\">Passing Session Tags in STS</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass session tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions to allow you to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_attribute-based-access-control.html\">Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>You can set the session tags as transitive. Transitive tags persist during role chaining. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html#id_session-tags_role-chaining\">Chaining Roles with Session Tags</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Using MFA with AssumeRole</b> </p> <p>(Optional) You can include multi-factor authentication (MFA) information when you call <code>AssumeRole</code>. This is useful for cross-account scenarios to ensure that the user that assumes the role has been authenticated with an Amazon Web Services MFA device. In that scenario, the trust policy of the role being assumed includes a condition that tests for MFA authentication. If the caller does not include valid MFA information, the request to assume the role is denied. The condition in a trust policy that tests for MFA authentication might look like the following example.</p> <p> <code>\"Condition\": {\"Bool\": {\"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent\": true}}</code> </p> <p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/MFAProtectedAPI.html\">Configuring MFA-Protected API Access</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i> guide.</p> <p>To use MFA with <code>AssumeRole</code>, you pass values for the <code>SerialNumber</code> and <code>TokenCode</code> parameters. The <code>SerialNumber</code> value identifies the user's hardware or virtual MFA device. The <code>TokenCode</code> is the time-based one-time password (TOTP) that the MFA device produces. </p>",

You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policy Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) to use as managed session policies. The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent Amazon Web Services API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session\">Session Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>When you create a role, you create two policies: a role trust policy that specifies <i>who</i> can assume the role, and a permissions policy that specifies <i>what</i> can be done with the role. You specify the trusted principal that is allowed to assume the role in the role trust policy.</p> <p>To assume a role from a different account, your Amazon Web Services account must be trusted by the role. The trust relationship is defined in the role's trust policy when the role is created. That trust policy states which accounts are allowed to delegate that access to users in the account. </p> <p>A user who wants to access a role in a different account must also have permissions that are delegated from the account administrator. The administrator must attach a policy that allows the user to call <code>AssumeRole</code> for the ARN of the role in the other account.</p> <p>To allow a user to assume a role in the same account, you can do either of the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Attach a policy to the user that allows the user to call <code>AssumeRole</code> (as long as the role's trust policy trusts the account).</p> </li> <li> <p>Add the user as a principal directly in the role's trust policy.</p> </li> </ul> <p>You can do either because the role’s trust policy acts as an IAM resource-based policy. When a resource-based policy grants access to a principal in the same account, no additional identity-based policy is required.

The administrator can also create granular permissions to allow you to pass only specific session tags.

This is useful for cross-account scenarios to ensure that the user that assumes the role has been authenticated with an Amazon Web Services MFA device. In that scenario, the trust policy of the role being assumed includes a condition that tests for MFA authentication. If the caller does not include valid MFA information, the request to assume the role is denied. The condition in a trust policy that tests for MFA authentication might look like the following example.</p> <p> <code>\"Condition\": {\"Bool\": {\"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent\": true}}</code> </p> <p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/MFAProtectedAPI.html\">Configuring MFA-Protected API Access</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i> guide.</p> <p>To use MFA with <code>AssumeRole</code>, you pass values for the <code>SerialNumber</code> and <code>TokenCode</code> parameters. The <code>SerialNumber</code> value identifies the user's hardware or virtual MFA device. The <code>TokenCode</code> is the time-based one-time password (TOTP) that the MFA device produces. </p>",

A typical use is in a proxy application that gets temporary security credentials on behalf of distributed applications inside a corporate network.</p> <p>You must call the <code>GetFederationToken</code> operation using the long-term security credentials of an IAM user. As a result, this call is appropriate in contexts where those credentials can be safeguarded, usually in a server-based application. For a comparison of <code>GetFederationToken</code> with the other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html\">Requesting Temporary Security Credentials</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison\">Comparing the Amazon Web Services STS API operations</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>Although it is possible to call <code>GetFederationToken</code> using the security credentials of an Amazon Web Services account root user rather than an IAM user that you create for the purpose of a proxy application, we do not recommend it. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#lock-away-credentials\">Safeguard your root user credentials and don't use them for everyday tasks</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. </p> <note> <p>You can create a mobile-based or browser-based app that can authenticate users using a web identity provider like Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or an OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider. In this case, we recommend that you use <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/cognito/\">Amazon Cognito</a> or <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code>. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_assumerolewithwebidentity\">Federation Through a Web-based Identity Provider</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> </note> <p> <b>Session duration</b> </p> <p>The temporary credentials are valid for the specified duration, from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to a maximum of 129,600 seconds (36 hours). The default session duration is 43,200 seconds (12 hours). Temporary credentials obtained by using the root user credentials have a maximum duration of 3,600 seconds (1 hour).</p> <p> <b>Permissions</b> </p> <p>You can use the temporary credentials created by <code>GetFederationToken</code> in any Amazon Web Services service with the following exceptions:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You cannot call any IAM operations using the CLI or the Amazon Web Services API. This limitation does not apply to console sessions.</p> </li> <li> <p>You cannot call any STS operations except <code>GetCallerIdentity</code>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>You can use temporary credentials for single sign-on (SSO) to the console.</p> <p>You must pass an inline or managed <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session\">session policy</a> to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policy Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) to use as managed session policies. The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters.</p> <p>Though the session policy parameters are optional, if you do not pass a policy, then the resulting federated user session has no permissions. When you pass session policies, the session permissions are the intersection of the IAM user policies and the session policies that you pass. This gives you a way to further restrict the permissions for a federated user. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those that are defined in the permissions policy of the IAM user. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session\">Session Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. For information about using <code>GetFederationToken</code> to create temporary security credentials, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_getfederationtoken\">GetFederationToken—Federation Through a Custom Identity Broker</a>. </p> <p>You can use the credentials to access a resource that has a resource-based policy. If that policy specifically references the federated user session in the <code>Principal</code> element of the policy, the session has the permissions allowed by the policy. These permissions are granted in addition to the permissions granted by the session policies.</p> <p> <b>Tags</b> </p> <p>(Optional) You can pass tag key-value pairs to your session. These are called session tags. For more information about session tags, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html\">Passing Session Tags in STS</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <note> <p>You can create a mobile-based or browser-based app that can authenticate users using a web identity provider like Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or an OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider. In this case, we recommend that you use <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/cognito/\">Amazon Cognito</a> or <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code>. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_assumerolewithwebidentity\">Federation Through a Web-based Identity Provider</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> </note> <p>An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass session tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions to allow you to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_attribute-based-access-control.html\">Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>Tag key–value pairs are not case sensitive, but case is preserved. This means that you cannot have separate <code>Department</code> and <code>department</code> tag keys. Assume that the user that you are federating has the <code>Department</code>=<code>Marketing</code> tag and you pass the <code>department</code>=<code>engineering</code> session tag. <code>Department</code> and <code>department</code> are not saved as separate tags, and the session tag passed in the request takes precedence over the user tag.</p>",

A typical use is in a proxy application that gets temporary security credentials on behalf of distributed applications inside a corporate network.</p> <p>You must call the <code>GetFederationToken</code> operation using the long-term security credentials of an IAM user. As a result, this call is appropriate in contexts where those credentials can be safeguarded, usually in a server-based application. For a comparison of <code>GetFederationToken</code> with the other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html\">Requesting Temporary Security Credentials</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison\">Comparing the Amazon Web Services STS API operations</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>Although it is possible to call <code>GetFederationToken</code> using the security credentials of an Amazon Web Services account root user rather than an IAM user that you create for the purpose of a proxy application, we do not recommend it.

In this case, we recommend that you use <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/cognito/\">Amazon Cognito</a> or <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code>. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_assumerolewithwebidentity\">Federation Through a Web-based Identity Provider</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> </note> <p> <b>Session duration</b> </p> <p>The temporary credentials are valid for the specified duration, from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to a maximum of 129,600 seconds (36 hours). The default session duration is 43,200 seconds (12 hours). Temporary credentials obtained by using the root user credentials have a maximum duration of 3,600 seconds (1 hour).</p> <p> <b>Permissions</b> </p> <p>You can use the temporary credentials created by <code>GetFederationToken</code> in any Amazon Web Services service with the following exceptions:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You cannot call any IAM operations using the CLI or the Amazon Web Services API. This limitation does not apply to console sessions.</p> </li> <li> <p>You cannot call any STS operations except <code>GetCallerIdentity</code>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>You can use temporary credentials for single sign-on (SSO) to the console.</p> <p>You must pass an inline or managed <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session\">session policy</a> to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policy Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) to use as managed session policies. The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters.</p> <p>Though the session policy parameters are optional, if you do not pass a policy, then the resulting federated user session has no permissions. When you pass session policies, the session permissions are the intersection of the IAM user policies and the session policies that you pass. This gives you a way to further restrict the permissions for a federated user. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those that are defined in the permissions policy of the IAM user. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session\">Session Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.

If that policy specifically references the federated user session in the <code>Principal</code> element of the policy, the session has the permissions allowed by the policy. These permissions are granted in addition to the permissions granted by the session policies.</p> <p> <b>Tags</b> </p> <p>(Optional) You can pass tag key-value pairs to your session. These are called session tags.
