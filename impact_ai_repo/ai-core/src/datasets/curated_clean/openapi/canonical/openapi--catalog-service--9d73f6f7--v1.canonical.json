    "description": "<p>Amazon Web Services Billing Conductor is a fully managed service that you can use to customize a <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/billingconductor/latest/userguide/understanding-eb.html#eb-other-definitions\">pro forma</a> version of your billing data each month, to accurately show or chargeback your end customers. Amazon Web Services Billing Conductor doesn't change the way you're billed by Amazon Web Services each month by design. Instead, it provides you with a mechanism to configure, generate, and display rates to certain customers over a given billing period. You can also analyze the difference between the rates you apply to your accounting groupings relative to your actual rates from Amazon Web Services. As a result of your Amazon Web Services Billing Conductor configuration, the payer account can also see the custom rate applied on the billing details page of the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing\">Amazon Web Services Billing console</a>, or configure a cost and usage report per billing group.</p> <p>This documentation shows how you can configure Amazon Web Services Billing Conductor using its API. For more information about using the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/billingconductor/\">Amazon Web Services Billing Conductor</a> user interface, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/billingconductor/latest/userguide/what-is-billingconductor.html\"> Amazon Web Services Billing Conductor User Guide</a>.</p>",
