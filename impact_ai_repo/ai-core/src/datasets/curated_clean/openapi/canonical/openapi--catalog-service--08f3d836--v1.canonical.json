RAM is a service that helps you securely share your Amazon Web Services resources to other Amazon Web Services accounts. If you use Organizations to manage your accounts, then you can share your resources with your entire organization or to organizational units (OUs). For supported resource types, you can also share resources with individual Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and users. </p> <p>To learn more about RAM, see the following resources:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ram\">Resource Access Manager product page</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/\">Resource Access Manager User Guide</a> </p> </li> </ul>",
