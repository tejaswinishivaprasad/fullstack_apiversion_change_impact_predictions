    "description": "<fullname>Key Management Service</fullname> <p>Key Management Service (KMS) is an encryption and key management web service. This guide describes the KMS operations that you can call programmatically. For general information about KMS, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/\"> <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i> </a>.</p> <note> <p>KMS has replaced the term <i>customer master key (CMK)</i> with <i>KMS key</i> and <i>KMS key</i>. The concept has not changed. To prevent breaking changes, KMS is keeping some variations of this term.</p> <p>Amazon Web Services provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, macOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to KMS and other Amazon Web Services services. For example, the SDKs take care of tasks such as signing requests (see below), managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including how to download and install them, see <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/tools/\">Tools for Amazon Web Services</a>.</p> </note> <p>We recommend that you use the Amazon Web Services SDKs to make programmatic API calls to KMS.</p> <p>If you need to use FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules when communicating with Amazon Web Services, use the FIPS endpoint in your preferred Amazon Web Services Region. For more information about the available FIPS endpoints, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/kms.html#kms_region\">Service endpoints</a> in the Key Management Service topic of the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>.</p> <p>All KMS API calls must be signed and be transmitted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). KMS recommends you always use the latest supported TLS version. Clients must also support cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) such as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes.</p> <p> <b>Signing Requests</b> </p> <p>Requests must be signed using an access key ID and a secret access key. We strongly recommend that you do not use your Amazon Web Services account root access key ID and secret access key for everyday work. You can use the access key ID and secret access key for an IAM user or you can use the Security Token Service (STS) to generate temporary security credentials and use those to sign requests. </p> <p>All KMS requests must be signed with <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html\">Signature Version 4</a>.</p> <p> <b>Logging API Requests</b> </p> <p>KMS supports CloudTrail, a service that logs Amazon Web Services API calls and related events for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers them to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. By using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were made to KMS, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/\">CloudTrail User Guide</a>.</p> <p> <b>Additional Resources</b> </p> <p>For more information about credentials and request signing, see the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-security-credentials.html\">Amazon Web Services Security Credentials</a> - This topic provides general information about the types of credentials used to access Amazon Web Services.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html\">Temporary Security Credentials</a> - This section of the <i>IAM User Guide</i> describes how to create and use temporary security credentials.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html\">Signature Version 4 Signing Process</a> - This set of topics walks you through the process of signing a request using an access key ID and a secret access key.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Commonly Used API Operations</b> </p> <p>Of the API operations discussed in this guide, the following will prove the most useful for most applications. You will likely perform operations other than these, such as creating keys and assigning policies, by using the console.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>Encrypt</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>Decrypt</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GenerateDataKey</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext</a> </p> </li> </ul>",

        "description": "<p>Replicates a multi-Region key into the specified Region. This operation creates a multi-Region replica key based on a multi-Region primary key in a different Region of the same Amazon Web Services partition. You can create multiple replicas of a primary key, but each must be in a different Region. To create a multi-Region primary key, use the <a>CreateKey</a> operation.</p> <p>This operation supports <i>multi-Region keys</i>, an KMS feature that lets you create multiple interoperable KMS keys in different Amazon Web Services Regions. Because these KMS keys have the same key ID, key material, and other metadata, you can use them interchangeably to encrypt data in one Amazon Web Services Region and decrypt it in a different Amazon Web Services Region without re-encrypting the data or making a cross-Region call. For more information about multi-Region keys, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html\">Multi-Region keys in KMS</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>A <i>replica key</i> is a fully-functional KMS key that can be used independently of its primary and peer replica keys. A primary key and its replica keys share properties that make them interoperable. They have the same <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-id-key-id\">key ID</a> and key material. They also have the same <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-spec\">key spec</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-usage\">key usage</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-origin\">key material origin</a>, and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/rotate-keys.html\">automatic key rotation status</a>. KMS automatically synchronizes these shared properties among related multi-Region keys. All other properties of a replica key can differ, including its <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html\">key policy</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/tagging-keys.html\">tags</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-alias.html\">aliases</a>, and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html\">Key states of KMS keys</a>. KMS pricing and quotas for KMS keys apply to each primary key and replica key.</p> <p>When this operation completes, the new replica key has a transient key state of <code>Creating</code>. This key state changes to <code>Enabled</code> (or <code>PendingImport</code>) after a few seconds when the process of creating the new replica key is complete. While the key state is <code>Creating</code>, you can manage key, but you cannot yet use it in cryptographic operations. If you are creating and using the replica key programmatically, retry on <code>KMSInvalidStateException</code> or call <code>DescribeKey</code> to check its <code>KeyState</code> value before using it. For details about the <code>Creating</code> key state, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html\">Key states of KMS keys</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>You cannot create more than one replica of a primary key in any Region. If the Region already includes a replica of the key you're trying to replicate, <code>ReplicateKey</code> returns an <code>AlreadyExistsException</code> error. If the key state of the existing replica is <code>PendingDeletion</code>, you can cancel the scheduled key deletion (<a>CancelKeyDeletion</a>) or wait for the key to be deleted. The new replica key you create will have the same <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html#mrk-sync-properties\">shared properties</a> as the original replica key.</p> <p>The CloudTrail log of a <code>ReplicateKey</code> operation records a <code>ReplicateKey</code> operation in the primary key's Region and a <a>CreateKey</a> operation in the replica key's Region.</p> <p>If you replicate a multi-Region primary key with imported key material, the replica key is created with no key material. You must import the same key material that you imported into the primary key. For details, see <a href=\"kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-import.html\">Importing key material into multi-Region keys</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>To convert a replica key to a primary key, use the <a>UpdatePrimaryRegion</a> operation.</p> <note> <p> <code>ReplicateKey</code> uses different default values for the <code>KeyPolicy</code> and <code>Tags</code> parameters than those used in the KMS console. For details, see the parameter descriptions.</p> </note> <p> <b>Cross-account use</b>: No. You cannot use this operation to create a replica key in a different Amazon Web Services account. </p> <p> <b>Required permissions</b>: </p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>kms:ReplicateKey</code> on the primary key (in the primary key's Region).

If the signature is verified, the value of the <code>SignatureValid</code> field in the response is <code>True</code>. If the signature verification fails, the <code>Verify</code> operation fails with an <code>KMSInvalidSignatureException</code> exception.</p> <p>A digital signature is generated by using the private key in an asymmetric KMS key. The signature is verified by using the public key in the same asymmetric KMS key. For information about asymmetric KMS keys, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html\">Asymmetric KMS keys</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>To use the <code>Verify</code> operation, specify the same asymmetric KMS key, message, and signing algorithm that were used to produce the signature. The message type does not need to be the same as the one used for signing, but it must indicate whether the value of the <code>Message</code> parameter should be hashed as part of the verification process.</p> <p>You can also verify the digital signature by using the public key of the KMS key outside of KMS. Use the <a>GetPublicKey</a> operation to download the public key in the asymmetric KMS key and then use the public key to verify the signature outside of KMS. The advantage of using the <code>Verify</code> operation is that it is performed within KMS. As a result, it's easy to call, the operation is performed within the FIPS boundary, it is logged in CloudTrail, and you can use key policy and IAM policy to determine who is authorized to use the KMS key to verify signatures.</p> <p>To verify a signature outside of KMS with an SM2 public key (China Regions only), you must specify the distinguishing ID. By default, KMS uses <code>1234567812345678</code> as the distinguishing ID.

When this operation is successful, the key state of the KMS key changes to <code>PendingDeletion</code> and the key can't be used in any cryptographic operations. It remains in this state for the duration of the waiting period. Before the waiting period ends, you can use <a>CancelKeyDeletion</a> to cancel the deletion of the KMS key. After the waiting period ends, KMS deletes the KMS key, its key material, and all KMS data associated with it, including all aliases that refer to it.</p> <important> <p>Deleting a KMS key is a destructive and potentially dangerous operation. When a KMS key is deleted, all data that was encrypted under the KMS key is unrecoverable. (The only exception is a <a href=\"kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-delete.html\">multi-Region replica key</a>, or an <a href=\"kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys-managing.html#import-delete-key\">asymmetric or HMAC KMS key with imported key material</a>.) To prevent the use of a KMS key without deleting it, use <a>DisableKey</a>. </p> </important> <p>You can schedule the deletion of a multi-Region primary key and its replica keys at any time. However, KMS will not delete a multi-Region primary key with existing replica keys. If you schedule the deletion of a primary key with replicas, its key state changes to <code>PendingReplicaDeletion</code> and it cannot be replicated or used in cryptographic operations. This status can continue indefinitely. When the last of its replicas keys is deleted (not just scheduled), the key state of the primary key changes to <code>PendingDeletion</code> and its waiting period (<code>PendingWindowInDays</code>) begins. For details, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-delete.html\">Deleting multi-Region keys</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>When KMS <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/delete-cmk-keystore.html\">deletes a KMS key from an CloudHSM key store</a>, it makes a best effort to delete the associated key material from the associated CloudHSM cluster. However, you might need to manually <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html#fix-keystore-orphaned-key\">delete the orphaned key material</a> from the cluster and its backups. <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/delete-xks-key.html\">Deleting a KMS key from an external key store</a> has no effect on the associated external key. However, for both types of custom key stores, deleting a KMS key is destructive and irreversible. You cannot decrypt ciphertext encrypted under the KMS key by using only its associated external key or CloudHSM key. Also, you cannot recreate a KMS key in an external key store by creating a new KMS key with the same key material.</p> <p>For more information about scheduling a KMS key for deletion, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/deleting-keys.html\">Deleting KMS keys</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state.

For more information about multi-Region keys, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html\">Multi-Region keys in KMS</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>The <i>primary key</i> of a multi-Region key is the source for properties that are always shared by primary and replica keys, including the key material, <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-id-key-id\">key ID</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-spec\">key spec</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-usage\">key usage</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-origin\">key material origin</a>, and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/rotate-keys.html\">automatic key rotation</a>. It's the only key that can be replicated. You cannot <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_ScheduleKeyDeletion.html\">delete the primary key</a> until all replica keys are deleted.</p> <p>The key ID and primary Region that you specify uniquely identify the replica key that will become the primary key. The primary Region must already have a replica key. This operation does not create a KMS key in the specified Region. To find the replica keys, use the <a>DescribeKey</a> operation on the primary key or any replica key. To create a replica key, use the <a>ReplicateKey</a> operation.</p> <p>You can run this operation while using the affected multi-Region keys in cryptographic operations. This operation should not delay, interrupt, or cause failures in cryptographic operations. </p> <p>Even after this operation completes, the process of updating the primary Region might still be in progress for a few more seconds. Operations such as <code>DescribeKey</code> might display both the old and new primary keys as replicas. The old and new primary keys have a transient key state of <code>Updating</code>. The original key state is restored when the update is complete. While the key state is <code>Updating</code>, you can use the keys in cryptographic operations, but you cannot replicate the new primary key or perform certain management operations, such as enabling or disabling these keys. For details about the <code>Updating</code> key state, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html\">Key states of KMS keys</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>This operation does not return any output.

To verify the updated property values, use the <a>DescribeCustomKeyStores</a> operation.</p> <p> This operation is part of the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html\">custom key stores</a> feature in KMS, which combines the convenience and extensive integration of KMS with the isolation and control of a key store that you own and manage.</p> <important> <p>When updating the properties of an external key store, verify that the updated settings connect your key store, via the external key store proxy, to the same external key manager as the previous settings, or to a backup or snapshot of the external key manager with the same cryptographic keys. If the updated connection settings fail, you can fix them and retry, although an extended delay might disrupt Amazon Web Services services. However, if KMS permanently loses its access to cryptographic keys, ciphertext encrypted under those keys is unrecoverable.</p> </important> <note> <p>For external key stores:</p> <p>Some external key managers provide a simpler method for updating an external key store. For details, see your external key manager documentation.</p> <p>When updating an external key store in the KMS console, you can upload a JSON-based proxy configuration file with the desired values. You cannot upload the proxy configuration file to the <code>UpdateCustomKeyStore</code> operation. However, you can use the file to help you determine the correct values for the <code>UpdateCustomKeyStore</code> parameters.</p> </note> <p>For an CloudHSM key store, you can use this operation to change the custom key store friendly name (<code>NewCustomKeyStoreName</code>), to tell KMS about a change to the <code>kmsuser</code> crypto user password (<code>KeyStorePassword</code>), or to associate the custom key store with a different, but related, CloudHSM cluster (<code>CloudHsmClusterId</code>). To update any property of an CloudHSM key store, the <code>ConnectionState</code> of the CloudHSM key store must be <code>DISCONNECTED</code>. </p> <p>For an external key store, you can use this operation to change the custom key store friendly name (<code>NewCustomKeyStoreName</code>), or to tell KMS about a change to the external key store proxy authentication credentials (<code>XksProxyAuthenticationCredential</code>), connection method (<code>XksProxyConnectivity</code>), external proxy endpoint (<code>XksProxyUriEndpoint</code>) and path (<code>XksProxyUriPath</code>). For external key stores with an <code>XksProxyConnectivity</code> of <code>VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE</code>, you can also update the Amazon VPC endpoint service name (<code>XksProxyVpcEndpointServiceName</code>). To update most properties of an external key store, the <code>ConnectionState</code> of the external key store must be <code>DISCONNECTED</code>. However, you can update the <code>CustomKeyStoreName</code>, <code>XksProxyAuthenticationCredential</code>, and <code>XksProxyUriPath</code> of an external key store when it is in the CONNECTED or DISCONNECTED state. </p> <p>If your update requires a <code>DISCONNECTED</code> state, before using <code>UpdateCustomKeyStore</code>, use the <a>DisconnectCustomKeyStore</a> operation to disconnect the custom key store. After the <code>UpdateCustomKeyStore</code> operation completes, use the <a>ConnectCustomKeyStore</a> to reconnect the custom key store. To find the <code>ConnectionState</code> of the custom key store, use the <a>DescribeCustomKeyStores</a> operation. </p> <p> </p> <p>Before updating the custom key store, verify that the new values allow KMS to connect the custom key store to its backing key store.

You can use this operation to change the KMS key under which data is encrypted, such as when you <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/rotate-keys.html#rotate-keys-manually\">manually rotate</a> a KMS key or change the KMS key that protects a ciphertext. You can also use it to reencrypt ciphertext under the same KMS key, such as to change the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#encrypt_context\">encryption context</a> of a ciphertext.</p> <p>The <code>ReEncrypt</code> operation can decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by using a KMS key in an KMS operation, such as <a>Encrypt</a> or <a>GenerateDataKey</a>. It can also decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by using the public key of an <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symm-asymm-concepts.html#asymmetric-cmks\">asymmetric KMS key</a> outside of KMS. However, it cannot decrypt ciphertext produced by other libraries, such as the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/\">Amazon Web Services Encryption SDK</a> or <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingClientSideEncryption.html\">Amazon S3 client-side encryption</a>. These libraries return a ciphertext format that is incompatible with KMS.</p> <p>When you use the <code>ReEncrypt</code> operation, you need to provide information for the decrypt operation and the subsequent encrypt operation.</p> <ul> <li> <p>If your ciphertext was encrypted under an asymmetric KMS key, you must use the <code>SourceKeyId</code> parameter to identify the KMS key that encrypted the ciphertext. You must also supply the encryption algorithm that was used. This information is required to decrypt the data.</p> </li> <li> <p>If your ciphertext was encrypted under a symmetric encryption KMS key, the <code>SourceKeyId</code> parameter is optional. KMS can get this information from metadata that it adds to the symmetric ciphertext blob. This feature adds durability to your implementation by ensuring that authorized users can decrypt ciphertext decades after it was encrypted, even if they've lost track of the key ID. However, specifying the source KMS key is always recommended as a best practice. When you use the <code>SourceKeyId</code> parameter to specify a KMS key, KMS uses only the KMS key you specify. If the ciphertext was encrypted under a different KMS key, the <code>ReEncrypt</code> operation fails. This practice ensures that you use the KMS key that you intend.</p> </li> <li> <p>To reencrypt the data, you must use the <code>DestinationKeyId</code> parameter to specify the KMS key that re-encrypts the data after it is decrypted. If the destination KMS key is an asymmetric KMS key, you must also provide the encryption algorithm. The algorithm that you choose must be compatible with the KMS key.</p> <important> <p>When you use an asymmetric KMS key to encrypt or reencrypt data, be sure to record the KMS key and encryption algorithm that you choose. You will be required to provide the same KMS key and encryption algorithm when you decrypt the data. If the KMS key and algorithm do not match the values used to encrypt the data, the decrypt operation fails.</p> <p>You are not required to supply the key ID and encryption algorithm when you decrypt with symmetric encryption KMS keys because KMS stores this information in the ciphertext blob. KMS cannot store metadata in ciphertext generated with asymmetric keys. The standard format for asymmetric key ciphertext does not include configurable fields.</p> </important> </li> </ul> <p>The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state.

The source KMS key and destination KMS key can be in different Amazon Web Services accounts. Either or both KMS keys can be in a different account than the caller.

A CloudHSM key store connection requires one free IP address in each of the associated private subnets, although two are preferable. For details, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html#fix-keystore-failed\">How to Fix a Connection Failure</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>INVALID_CREDENTIALS</code> — The <code>KeyStorePassword</code> for the custom key store doesn't match the current password of the <code>kmsuser</code> crypto user in the CloudHSM cluster. Before you can connect your custom key store to its CloudHSM cluster, you must change the <code>kmsuser</code> account password and update the <code>KeyStorePassword</code> value for the custom key store.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>SUBNET_NOT_FOUND</code> — A subnet in the CloudHSM cluster configuration was deleted. If KMS cannot find all of the subnets in the cluster configuration, attempts to connect the custom key store to the CloudHSM cluster fail. To fix this error, create a cluster from a recent backup and associate it with your custom key store. (This process creates a new cluster configuration with a VPC and private subnets.)

Before you can connect your custom key store to its CloudHSM cluster, you must change the <code>kmsuser</code> account password and update the key store password value for the custom key store.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>USER_LOGGED_IN</code> — The <code>kmsuser</code> CU account is logged into the associated CloudHSM cluster. This prevents KMS from rotating the <code>kmsuser</code> account password and logging into the cluster. Before you can connect your custom key store to its CloudHSM cluster, you must log the <code>kmsuser</code> CU out of the cluster. If you changed the <code>kmsuser</code> password to log into the cluster, you must also and update the key store password value for the custom key store.

Verify that the XKS proxy supports TLS 1.2 or 1.3. Also, verify that the TLS certificate is not expired, and that it matches the hostname in the <code>XksProxyUriEndpoint</code> value, and that it is signed by a certificate authority included in the <a href=\"https://github.com/aws/aws-kms-xksproxy-api-spec/blob/main/TrustedCertificateAuthorities\">Trusted Certificate Authorities</a> list.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>XKS_PROXY_NOT_REACHABLE</code> — KMS can't communicate with your external key store proxy. Verify that the <code>XksProxyUriEndpoint</code> and <code>XksProxyUriPath</code> are correct. Use the tools for your external key store proxy to verify that the proxy is active and available on its network. Also, verify that your external key manager instances are operating properly. Connection attempts fail with this connection error code if the proxy reports that all external key manager instances are unavailable.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>XKS_PROXY_TIMED_OUT</code> — KMS can connect to the external key store proxy, but the proxy does not respond to KMS in the time allotted.

A CloudHSM key store connection requires one free IP address in each of the associated private subnets, although two are preferable. For details, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html#fix-keystore-failed\">How to Fix a Connection Failure</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>INVALID_CREDENTIALS</code> — The <code>KeyStorePassword</code> for the custom key store doesn't match the current password of the <code>kmsuser</code> crypto user in the CloudHSM cluster. Before you can connect your custom key store to its CloudHSM cluster, you must change the <code>kmsuser</code> account password and update the <code>KeyStorePassword</code> value for the custom key store.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>SUBNET_NOT_FOUND</code> — A subnet in the CloudHSM cluster configuration was deleted. If KMS cannot find all of the subnets in the cluster configuration, attempts to connect the custom key store to the CloudHSM cluster fail. To fix this error, create a cluster from a recent backup and associate it with your custom key store. (This process creates a new cluster configuration with a VPC and private subnets.)

Before you can connect your custom key store to its CloudHSM cluster, you must change the <code>kmsuser</code> account password and update the key store password value for the custom key store.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>USER_LOGGED_IN</code> — The <code>kmsuser</code> CU account is logged into the associated CloudHSM cluster. This prevents KMS from rotating the <code>kmsuser</code> account password and logging into the cluster. Before you can connect your custom key store to its CloudHSM cluster, you must log the <code>kmsuser</code> CU out of the cluster. If you changed the <code>kmsuser</code> password to log into the cluster, you must also and update the key store password value for the custom key store.

Also, verify that the TLS certificate is not expired, and that it matches the hostname in the <code>XksProxyUriEndpoint</code> value, and that it is signed by a certificate authority included in the <a href=\"https://github.com/aws/aws-kms-xksproxy-api-spec/blob/main/TrustedCertificateAuthorities\">Trusted Certificate Authorities</a> list.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>XKS_PROXY_NOT_REACHABLE</code> — KMS can't communicate with your external key store proxy. Verify that the <code>XksProxyUriEndpoint</code> and <code>XksProxyUriPath</code> are correct. Use the tools for your external key store proxy to verify that the proxy is active and available on its network. Also, verify that your external key manager instances are operating properly.
